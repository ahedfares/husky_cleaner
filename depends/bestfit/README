best-fit
Alasdair Craig

Dependencies
============

Boost must be preinstalled as best-fit depends on Boost for the following:

1. boost::ublas for the matrix operations;
2. boost::program_options for parsing the command line options when building without BEST_FIT_LIB #defined (ie. building an .exe not a .lib)


Build instructions
==================


#define BEST_FIT_LIB in main.cpp to build a static library. Alternatively omit to build an executable. 

Linux: Build using the Makefile.
Windows: Visual Studio 2008 .sln and .vcproj is provided.
